"""Views for the grapheme→IPA review UI (place#252).

Access, in three layers, because they answer three different questions.

**Reading is public.** Anyone can browse the rule sets, see what is proposed,
see where reviewers disagree, and run a name through the sandbox without an
account. That is deliberate: this is scholarly work in progress, and a review
record nobody outside can inspect is not a review record. Signing in is required
only to *contribute* — a suggestion has to be attributable, and a contributor
has to have been shown the licence they are agreeing to.

**Before launch, reading is not yet public.** ``settings.PHONETICS_PUBLIC``
holds the app to staff and beta users while it is being finished; everyone else
gets a 404 rather than a "not yet" page. Flipping it is not sufficient on its
own — :func:`_gate` also requires contribution terms someone has signed off,
because non-negotiable 6 of place#252 is that licensing is settled before launch
and a flag someone has to remember is not a settlement.

**Staff only** for the sync, and for the machine-readable suggestion feed, which
carries reviewer comments and attribution.
