"""Grapheme→IPA rule review (place#252).

Reviewers correct the rule sets that turn a place name into IPA for
cross-script matching. Three things about the shape here are deliberate and
easy to undo by accident:

**Nothing in this app edits a rule set.** The CSVs live in the ``indexing``
repo and are changed there, by hand or by agents processing what is recorded
here. :class:`Rule` is a read-only mirror of the file as fetched; a reviewer's
work is a :class:`Review`, which is a *proposal*. Export writes a candidate
file for a human to look at; installation stays a separate, deliberate step
somewhere else.

**Silence is not agreement.** A row nobody has looked at and a row every
reviewer accepted must never be the same state. There is no "approved"
boolean; status is derived from the reviews that exist, and the absence of
reviews is its own named state (:attr:`Rule.UNREVIEWED`).

**Reviews are append-only.** Disagreement is the signal we are collecting, so
nothing is overwritten and no minority answer is resolved away. A reviewer who
changes their mind adds a row and the old one stops being ``is_latest``.
