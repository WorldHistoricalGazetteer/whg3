"""Pull the rule sets from the ``indexing`` repo into the review database.

The CSVs are not ours to edit. They live in ``WorldHistoricalGazetteer/indexing``
and change there — by hand, and by agents processing what reviewers record here.
This module mirrors them; nothing in this app ever writes one back.

**Why a sync and not a fetch per page load.** Three reasons, in order of how
much they would hurt:

1. A review has to name the value it was made against. If the file is re-read on
   every request, a row can change under a reviewer between the page rendering
   and their verdict posting, and the verdict silently attaches to a value they
   never saw. :class:`~phonetics.models.RuleSetVersion` and
   ``Review.reviewed_ipa`` exist to make that impossible; both need a fetch that
   happens at a known moment.
2. 115 files per page view against a third-party API is not a page load.
3. GitHub would rate-limit it within a minute.

So: a scheduled sync (and a staff "sync now" button) writes versions; page loads
read the database. Latency after an upstream edit is bounded by the schedule,
which is the right trade for reviews that can be trusted afterwards.

**Costs almost nothing when nothing changed.** The contents listing returns the
git blob sha of every file, and a blob sha *is* the content — so a file whose
sha we already hold is skipped without being downloaded. A no-op sync of 115
rule sets is two API calls.

**Adoption is detected, not asserted.** When a synced value turns out to equal
a proposal someone made, that review is stamped ``adopted_upstream_at``. Nobody
upstream has to remember to tell us, and the credit is therefore reliable.
