"""Export a reviewed rule set back to Epitran's ``Orth,Phon`` CSV.

Round-tripping to that format is the point: it is the consuming artefact, and a
review that cannot be handed back in the form the pipeline eats is a review
nobody can act on.

**What comes out is a proposal.** This never writes to the ``indexing`` repo and
never installs anything; it produces a candidate file for a person to look at.
Two things follow from that and are deliberate:

* Rows nobody reviewed are exported **unchanged**, and the accompanying report
  says so. Silence is not agreement, and a diff that quietly folds unexamined
  rows into "reviewed output" would launder it into agreement.
* A **disputed** row is exported unchanged too, with the competing proposals
  listed in the report. Picking a winner here would resolve by algorithm exactly
  the disagreement the app exists to preserve.
