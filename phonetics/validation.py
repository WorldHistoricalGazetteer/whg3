"""Validation of proposed grapheme→IPA values, against the consumer.

The rule sets reviewed here are consumed by Epitran/PanPhon in the indexing
pipeline. A value that PanPhon cannot use is worthless however good the
linguistic judgement behind it, so every proposal is checked against PanPhon
*before* it is recorded — collecting expert time on a value the pipeline will
silently discard is the worst outcome available (place#252, non-negotiable 2).

Three things here are not obvious and each of them has already bitten this
project (place#251):

1. **Parsing successfully is not enough.** PanPhon accepts ``ⁿɡ`` and hands
   back ``['ɡ']``; ``dʒʰ`` comes back as ``['d', 'ʒ']``. No error is raised —
   the prenasalisation and the aspiration are simply gone. So the check is not
   "did it parse?" but "do the parsed segments still spell what was submitted?"
   See :func:`validate_ipa`.

2. **Normalisation decides the answer, in both directions.** PanPhon segments
   ``ẽ`` when it is decomposed (U+0065 U+0303) and drops the tilde when it is
   composed (U+1EBD) — the same glyph, opposite outcomes. Meanwhile a
   duplicate-grapheme check has to compare NFD because Unicode's composition
   exclusions mean NFC will *not* merge Gurmukhi ``ਸ਼`` written precomposed
   (U+0A36) with the same letter written decomposed (U+0A38 U+0A3C); a rule set
   carrying both fails to load. Everything here is therefore normalised to NFD
   before it is compared or stored.

3. **Confusables render identically.** ASCII ``g`` (U+0067) is not IPA ``ɡ``
   (U+0261) and PanPhon rejects it, but no reviewer will see the difference in
   a form field. They are named explicitly rather than left to the generic
   "unparseable" message, which would tell the reviewer nothing actionable.
