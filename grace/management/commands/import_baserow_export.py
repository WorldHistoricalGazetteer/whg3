"""Import the Baserow snapshot into GRACE (step 7).

The snapshot lives in ``developer/baserow-export/`` — a full read-only export of
the WHG Baserow workspace, taken 27 August 2026 immediately before the service
account was deleted. It is **gitignored**, because this repository is public and
the export holds names, email addresses and phone numbers. That means this
command only works on a machine where someone has put the export in place.

Idempotent. Every table is matched on a natural key and updated in place, so
re-running never duplicates:

============================  ==================================  ==============
Baserow table                 GRACE model                         matched on
============================  ==================================  ==============
Print Gazetteer Bibliography  ``Source`` (printed gazetteer)      title + volume
Possible Datasets             ``TrackedDataset`` (prospects)     title
People ALL                    ``Person``                          email, else name
============================  ==================================  ==============

Deliberately **not** imported:

* *Licences* — ``licensing.License`` is already the single source of truth, and
  that Baserow table was only ever a mirror of it.
* *Project Management* (the whole database) — Baserow's stock template, not WHG
  data.
* *Comparable Projects / Environmental Scan* — a survey of other people's
  projects; useful reading, but not the Catalogue. Import it by hand if wanted.

**On the people import.** Contacts are created under legitimate interests (see
``grace/privacy.py``), and every one of them starts with no Article 14 notice
recorded — which is correct, because none has been sent. They will appear in
``grace_retention_review`` as overdue after a month. That is the system working:
these are exactly the people the obligation exists for. Pass ``--skip-people``
to load the non-personal tables first if you would rather do that separately.
