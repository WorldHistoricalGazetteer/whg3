"""The "Resend Verification Email" button must actually send one.

The template renders it as::

    <button type="submit" name="resend_verification" class="...">

with no ``value``. Per HTML, a submit button with a name and no value submits the **empty
string** — so ``request.POST.get('resend_verification')`` returned ``''``, which is falsy, and
the ``elif`` guarding the resend branch never fired. The view fell through to the GET-rendering
path: HTTP 200, no email, and no error message either. Entirely silent.

Reported 2026-09-10 by a user who had clicked it repeatedly across two days and received
nothing. His request log is the signature: every ``POST /profile/`` returning 200, never the
302 the resend branch always produces when it is reached.

These tests post the button exactly as a browser does — ``{'resend_verification': ''}`` — so a
regression to truthiness-testing fails here rather than in a support ticket.
